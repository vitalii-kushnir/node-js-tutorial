# Now That's Delicious!

Together we will build "Now That's Delicious!", a full stack restaurant application which users can search, geolocate, review and curate their favourite restaurants from around the world.

The application has three main models — **Users**, **Stores** and **Reviews** — all of which are relational. It is designed to hit upon many of today's application needs such as user authentication, database storage, Ajax REST API, file upload and image resizing.

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```
